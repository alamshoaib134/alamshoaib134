Hi there! 👋 My name is Shoaib Alam and I am a passionate 💻 computer science student currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science from IIT Gandhinagar. My focus is on Natural Language Processing 🗣️, and I am currently working on my thesis in this area.

Before joining IIT Gandhinagar, I completed my undergraduate studies at BIT Durg, where I gained a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering. I have always been interested in the intersection of technology and language, and my work in Natural Language Processing allows me to explore this intersection in greater depth.

As a programmer, I am experienced in several programming languages and tools, including Python 🐍, Java ☕, and Git 🌳. I am also skilled in data analysis and machine learning 🤖, which are critical components of my work in Natural Language Processing.

In addition to my academic work, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects on GitHub. I believe that open-source software is a powerful tool for driving innovation and advancing the state of the art in computer science. On my GitHub profile, you can find examples of my work in Natural Language Processing, as well as other projects that I have contributed to.

Thank you for taking the time to read my profile, and I look forward to connecting with others in the computer science community! 😊

If you want to get in touch with me, the best way to reach me is via email 📧 at alamshoaib134@gmail.com or shoaibalam@iitgn.ac.in. I check my email regularly and will do my best to respond promptly ⏱️.
