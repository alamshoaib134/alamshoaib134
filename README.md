👋 Hi there! I'm a passionate Data Engineer currently shaping the future of data at Nike. With a strong foundation in Spark and Big Data, I navigate through massive datasets with ease, primarily using Python and Scala. My enthusiasm doesn't stop at data engineering; I'm deeply fascinated by AI and ML, constantly exploring new tools and technologies to broaden my horizon.

🎓 Holding a Master's degree from IIT Gandhinagar, my academic journey was marked by an intense focus on NLP (Natural Language Processing), where I had the opportunity to contribute to the field through my thesis. This experience has not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the power of language in AI.

🌌 Beyond the world of codes and algorithms, I find solace in astronomy and the mysteries of the universe. Travelling to new places allows me to connect with diverse cultures and perspectives, enriching my personal and professional life.

Let's connect and explore the infinite possibilities in the realm of data, AI, and beyond!
